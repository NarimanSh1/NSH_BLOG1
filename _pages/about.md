Homework 1. 
Use law of acting masses for a reaction. 
The irreversible interaction of gaseous substances A and B at 40 °C was studied at a total initial pressure of 100 kPa and different molar ratio of the reactants. The data obtained are summarised in the table:
PA : PB	1 : 9	1 : 4	3 : 7	2 : 3	1 : 1	3 : 2	7 : 3	4 : 1	9 : 1
Ptotal, kPA (5 min)	98.75	97.80	97.13	96.74	96.63	96.79	97.21	97.89	98.82
Ptotal, kPa (24 hr)	90.00	80.00	70.00	70.00	75.00	80.00	85.00	90.00	95.00

1.	Write down a possible equation of the reaction taking place in the vessel, taking into account that all reaction products are gaseous.
2.	Determine the orders of reaction for substances A and B. In what ratio should these gases be mixed to maximise the rate of reaction?
If the reaction is carried out at 50 °C at an initial pressure of 100 kPa and a ratio of A and B of 4:6, it will take half as long to reach the same pressure as in the previous experiment.
3.	Estimate the activation energy of the reaction of the interaction of A and B.
At higher temperatures, the interaction of A and B becomes reversible. For example, when a mixture of A and B is held for an extended period of time in a 3:7 ratio and an initial pressure of 100 kPa, the total pressure drops to only 80 kPa at 120 °C and only 85 kPa at 140 °C.
4.	Calculate the equilibrium constants of the reversible interaction of A and B at the temperatures given and the enthalpy of this reaction.
5.	At what temperature will the total pressure after equilibrium is established decrease to only 90 kPa for the same initial pressure and reactant ratio?
